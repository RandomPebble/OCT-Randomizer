# OCT-Randomizer
I don't know how this usually goes but????? HI this is my randomizer I'm sorry this file is probably really messy

Please do not remove the credits at the bottom of the webpage! 

If you hover your mouse over stuff, there should be a tooltip that comes up if you're unclear about what something is for :)


Loading Contestants into the Generator
====================
1. Manual entry: You can enter the number of teams (ie. if you have 32 contestants, you would enter 32).
This will generate a blank Name and Image URL input box for every contestant that you fill in manually. 

2. File upload: If you have the images you want to use on your device, you can directly upload them, and it will generate the Names and Image URLs automatically.
By default, it will use the name of the file for the Name, but you can edit it. Do NOT edit the Image URL that is generated.

The Image URL is the link to the image you want to use for the contestant, and Name is the text that will appear below the image.
Everything must be filled in before proceeding to generation.


Generating Matchups
====================
1. Default Generation: Pairs up contestants at random with no restrictions.

2. Custom Generation: Allows you to exclude matchups if necessary. Instructions are on the page. (Thank you catphantoms for this!!)

Once you generate the matchups, it will go to a blank page with a button to start displaying the matchups. 
This is where I would start the stream on, so the audience doesn't need to see the setup work, but the portraits won't be spoiled for them yet either :> 


Customizing the Generator
====================
IMPORTANT: The customization makes use of your browser's localstorage. If your browser clears its cache/cookies/etc, then everything will be reset to default.

You can access the customization menu from the main page, below the contestant entry options. 
Each option should be fairly self-explanatory, but if you're not sure, a more detailed tooltip will come up if you hover your mouse over the different options.

You're free to go into the files and code/css themselves to have more control over your exact customizations, as long as the credits are not removed :D


UHHH I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE. LET ME KNOW IF YOU FIND A BUG OR SOMETHING THX
